# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In this project, I intend to use supervised machine learning techniques to conduct a credit risk analyis on a credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. In doing so, I will utlize Python and Jupyter Notebook, to read and run multiple classification analysis and then compare the obtained results. Specifically, after preprocessing the dataset, I will use LogisticRegression classifier to develop a predictive model and attempt to imporove its performance (given the imbalanced nature of loan risk status) through different resampling technqiues including over-, under-, and combined resampling. Next, I will apply easy ensemble and balanced random forests classifiers on the same dataset hoping to achieve higher predictive performance in comparison to the logisticregression. In the next sections, I provide the analyses results and conclude will a brief interpretation.

## Results

Below I added a screenshot of the results for each classifier and a short description.
